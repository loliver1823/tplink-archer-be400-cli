# tplink-archer-be400-cli

Full CLI + MCP server for the **TP-Link Archer BE400** router — 192 reverse-engineered API endpoints, 37 CLI commands, 14 MCP tools for AI integration (including Avira parental-control domain blocking).

> **BE400-only.** This tool was built by reverse-engineering the Archer BE400's web UI JavaScript bundles (originally firmware v1.0.4, build 2024-09-04; catalog extended and verified against the 2025 firmware / web-UI bundle v1.11.0). It may partially work on other TP-Link routers that share the same firmware platform, but full compatibility is only guaranteed for the BE400.

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/loliver1823/tplink-archer-be400-cli.git
```

Or clone and install locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/loliver1823/tplink-archer-be400-cli.git
cd tplink-archer-be400-cli
pip install .
```

## First-Time Setup

```bash
tplink-be400 --setup
```

This creates a config file at `~/.config/tplink-be400/config.toml`. Edit it with your router's IP and password:

```toml
[auth]
password = "YourRouterPasswordHere"

[routers.r1]
host = "http://192.168.0.1"
label = "Main Router"

# Multiple routers supported:
# [routers.r2]
# host = "http://192.168.0.202"
# label = "AP Mode Router"
```

You can also skip the config file entirely and pass credentials directly:

```bash
tplink-be400 --host 192.168.0.1 --password YourPassword status
```

## Usage

```
tplink-be400 <router> <command> [args...]
```

Where `<router>` is a key from your config (e.g. `r1`).

## Rate Limiting / Router Stability

The BE400's web server is an embedded system with limited resources. **Rapid-fire API calls can crash the router**, causing a watchdog reboot with no crash logs.

Guidelines for safe usage:

- **Single commands are always safe.** Normal CLI usage (one command at a time) will never cause issues.
- **Scripting**: Add at least a 2-second delay between commands. Avoid running `dump` repeatedly.
- **Session churn**: Each CLI invocation creates a new authenticated session (RSA key exchange + AES encryption). Running many commands in rapid succession creates heavy CPU load on the router.
- **The `dump` command** reads all 192 endpoints sequentially and takes ~90 seconds. Don't run it more than once every few minutes.
- **The `monitor` command** uses a 25-second polling interval by design.

If the router becomes unresponsive after heavy API usage, wait 60-90 seconds for it to reboot automatically.

## MCP Server (AI Integration)

This package includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that lets AI assistants like Claude and Cursor interact with the router directly through structured tools instead of shell commands.

### Why MCP Instead of Shell

- **Persistent session** — one RSA+AES handshake reused across all calls (no session churn that can crash the router)
- **Built-in rate limiting** — 1.5s minimum between API calls, enforced automatically
- **Structured JSON** — every response is clean dicts/lists, not formatted text to parse
- **Auto-reconnect** — if the session times out, it silently re-authenticates

### MCP Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/loliver1823/tplink-archer-be400-cli.git
```

Then register the server. For **Cursor**, create/edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tplink-be400": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "tplink_be400.mcp_server"]
    }
  }
}
```

For **Claude Desktop**, add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tplink-be400": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "tplink_be400.mcp_server"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart your AI client after adding the config. The server reads credentials from the same `~/.config/tplink-be400/config.toml` as the CLI.

### MCP Tools (14 total)

| Tool | Description | Writes? |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `router_overview` | One-call dashboard: firmware, CPU, memory, WAN, WiFi summary, device count, internet status | No |
| `list_devices` | All connected clients with hostname, IP, MAC, connection type | No |
| `get_setting` | Read any topic ("wifi", "wan", "firewall", etc.) or raw endpoint name; optional `router` key (`r1`, `r2`, …) | No |
| `change_setting` | Write key=value pairs to an endpoint, returns before/after diff | **Yes** |
| `get_logs` | System logs with optional type filter (NETWORK, FIREWALL, NAT, etc.) | No |
| `find_endpoints` | Search the 192-endpoint catalog by keyword | No |
| `discover_routers` | Scan LAN for TP-Link web admin; optional auth; appends new `[routers.*]` to `~/.config/tplink-be400/config.toml` unless `skip_persist` | **Yes** (local file) |
| `run_diagnostic` | Ping test + port status + WAN speed in one call | No |
| `reboot_router` | Reboot with mandatory `confirm: true` safety gate | **Yes** |
| `parental_profiles` | List Avira parental-control profiles (ownerId, bound MACs, blocked-domain lists) and limits | No |
| `parental_devices` | List devices known to parental controls (name, MAC, type, online) | No |
| `parental_block_domains` | Create a profile that blocks given domains for device MAC(s) — e.g. Samsung TV ad/telemetry. Keeps general internet (HTTPS blocked too, via gateway DNS) | **Yes** |
| `parental_set_filter` | Replace the blocked-domain list of an existing profile (`owner_id`, `domains`) | **Yes** |
| `parental_delete_profile` | Delete a parental-control profile by `owner_id` | **Yes** |

### `get_setting` Topics

The `get_setting` tool accepts high-level topic names that aggregate multiple endpoints:

`wifi`, `wan`, `lan`, `dhcp`, `firewall`, `parental`, `nat`, `qos`, `vpn`, `admin`, `mesh`, `ipv6`, `ddns`, `upnp`, `led`, `eco`, `time`, `firmware`, `disk`, `sharing`, `iptv`, `imb`, `cloud`, `logs`, `ports`, `routes`, `guest`

Or pass any endpoint shortname (e.g. `wireless/ofdma`, `nat/dmz`) for a single raw read. Use `find_endpoints` to search the catalog.

### MCP Examples

```
# AI calls router_overview → gets full dashboard as JSON
router_overview()
→ { firmware: { model: "Archer BE400", version: "1.1.2 ..." }, performance: { cpu_percent: 11.0, memory_percent: 46.0 }, clients: { total: 20 }, wan: { ip: "180.150.x.x", uptime_human: "4h 23m" }, ... }

# AI calls get_setting with topic "wifi" → gets all WiFi config
get_setting(topic="wifi")
→ { data: { "wireless/wireless_2g": { ssid: "MyNetwork", channel: "6", ... }, ... } }

# AI calls change_setting → changes a setting with confirmation
change_setting(endpoint="security/firewall", settings={"wan_ping": "on"})
→ { success: true, changes: { wan_ping: { before: "off", after: "on" } } }

# AI calls find_endpoints → searches the catalog
find_endpoints(query="vpn")
→ { endpoints: [{ name: "openvpn/config", path: "admin/openvpn?form=config", operation: "read" }, ...] }
```

### Parental Controls (Per-Device Domain Blocking)

The BE400's Avira-based parental controls are exposed via the `parental_*` tools. Each "profile" (owner) binds one or more device MACs to a blocked-domain list (up to 64 domains). Blocking is enforced at the gateway via DNS manipulation, so it also drops **HTTPS** connections to those domains while leaving the device's general internet intact. A common use is killing Smart-TV ad/telemetry without touching the rest of the network.

```
# Block Samsung Smart TV ad/telemetry on one device
parental_block_domains(
  name="TV-AdBlock",
  macs="D0-D0-03-D5-B4-E4",
  domains="samsungads.com,samsungadhub.com,samsungacr.com",
)
→ { success: true, data: { ownerId: 0 } }

# Inspect, edit, or remove later
parental_profiles()                                          # find the ownerId + current lists
parental_set_filter(owner_id="0", domains="samsungads.com,extra.com")   # replaces the list
parental_delete_profile(owner_id="0")                        # removes the block
```

> Wire format note: parental controls use the `admin/avira_parental_control` endpoint, which takes its operation/params in the URL query and returns a non-standard (bare-blob) response — handled by `avira.py`, not the generic `get_setting`/`change_setting` path.

## How It Works

This tool communicates with the router's internal web API — the same API that the browser-based admin panel uses. All endpoints were discovered by reverse-engineering the router's JavaScript bundles.

Authentication uses RSA + AES encryption (handled by the `tplinkrouterc6u` library). Every request goes through the same encrypted channel as the web UI.
